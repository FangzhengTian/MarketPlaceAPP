MarketPlaceAPP
==============
This is the Android Application code of my capstone project - Mobile Strategy and Analytics for Health Benefit Exchange.

Background information: In US, the federal government and some state governments have a website called marketplace which contains a lot of insurance plans. Citizens can browse insurance plan information, apply for a plan and check status of their application. Because the use of mobile phones is increasing, the governments want to have a mobile application of the marketplace.

I was responsible for developing a mobile prototype of the marketplace. There are three parts of the prototype. An Android mobile application serves as the front end. Some Java servlets serve as the back end. A MySQL database is installed in the server side.

The code in this repository is the Android Application part.
